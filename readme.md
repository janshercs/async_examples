## Jansen's async demo scripts
This is a very basic usage of asyncio module in python.
Mainly demonstrates: 1. chaining of async processes and 2. Using async queues to clear tasks. 
It is still far from perfect and my understanding is some what limited. 
I hope this will serve as a sample scripts to write async scripts in the future.
